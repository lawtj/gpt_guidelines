Publish,"Baricitinib 
(JAK inhibitor)","Many guideline authorities recommend the use of the antiinflammatory JAK-2 inhibitor baricitinib in addition to steroids in patients who are admitted to the hospital with severe to critical COVID pneumonia and have increasing oxygen requirements or other evidence of widespread inflammation. Most institutions recommend 4mg PO daily for up to 14 days, with dose-adjustment based on renal function. IL-6 inhibitors like tocilizumab or sarilumab may be used as an alternative to baricitinib; most institutions do not recommend one agent over another due to lack of data directly comparing them, but some instutitions, like UCSF, favor a particular medication as first line (baricitinib, in the case of UCSF). Baricitinib and IL-6 inhibitors should not be used concurrently. Some data additionally support baricitinib in place of steroids if there is a strong contraindication to the use of steroids (such cases are rare). Some institutions specify that tocilizumab should be used in place of baricitinib in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. See institution guideline links for details.

WHO makes a strong recommendation for use of baricitinib in addition to corticosteroids in patients with severe or critical COVID-19, including those requiring mechanical ventilation. Baricitinib (or IL-6 inhibitors) should be used with systemic steroids. Additional data from RECOVERY showed combinng corticosteroids, IL-6 receptor inhibitors and baricitinib provided incremental safety benefit and can be administered jointly. However, clinicians may opt for less agressive immunosuppressive therapy and/or combine medications in a stepwise fashion in patients who are deteoriating. WHO does recommend baricitinib over IL-6 inhibitors or vice-versa, and instead suggests that selection of one agent or another may depend on experience and comfort using the drugs; local institutional policies; route of administration (baricitinib is oral; IL-6 receptor blockers are intravenous); and cost. Additionally, clinical trials were not representative of the global population and risk benefit may be less advantageous, particularly in areas where certain infectious diseases such as HIV, TB, and certain fungal infections are endemic or in patients with increased risk of opportunistic infections.

The FDA has issued an EUA for anakinra for treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen at risk for progressing to severe resrpiratory failure and elevated soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). Data supporting anakinra for COVID-19 was demonstrated in the SAVE-MORE trial which showed 70% decrease in relative risk of progression to severe respiratory failrue and 28d mortality with anakinra compared to standard of care. Most institutions do not make a recommendation on anakinra due to insufficient evidence and which patient population would benefit from anakinra given use of suPAR which is not widely available. ,"Early treatment of COVID-19 with anakinra guided by soluble urokinase plasminogen receptor plasma levels: a double-blind, randomized controlled phase 3 trial",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01499-z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No recommendation,,,,,No recommendation,,,,,,,,,,,,,Inconclusive,,,4/4/2023,The NIH cites insufficient evidence to either recommend for or against the use of anakinra.,Don't,https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/covid-19-guideline-treatment-and-management/#Recommendation31:Anakinra,,6/26/2023,"IDSA gives a conditional recommendation against the use of anakinra recognizing that additional research is needed to identify which patients are most likely to benefit and alternative immunomodulator therapies already recommended (baricitinib, steroids, tociluzamab).
